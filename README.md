# Asterisk-Search-Algorithm-Visualizer

(  This project is implemented using **Python3** and the library [**pygame**](https://www.pygame.org/news)  )

## General Info

A simple desktop app that shows the workflow of the [__A* Search Algorithm__](https://theory.stanford.edu/~amitp/GameProgramming/AStarComparison.html), which finds the shortest path between two points (_start_ and _end_).

## How to use it ?

1. Clone/Download the repository
2. Execute the main.py file
3. Use the LEFT-key of your mouse to choose the positions of the **start-point** (orange color), the **end-point** (turquoise color), and the **obstacles** (black color).
